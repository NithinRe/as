Alright, let's address each question in order:

**1. Please prove the following properties:**

   a. **The inverse of a rotation matrix \( R \) in \( SO(3) \) is also a rotation matrix, and it is equal to the transpose of \( R \), i.e., \( R^{-1} = R^T \).**
   
   **Proof:**
   A rotation matrix \( R \) in \( SO(3) \) has the properties:
   1. \( R^T R = I \) (where \( I \) is the identity matrix)
   2. \( det(R) = 1 \)

   Given \( R^T R = I \), multiplying both sides by \( R^T \) gives:
   \[ R^T R R^T = R^T \]
   \[ R^T = R^{-1} \]

   Thus, the inverse of \( R \) is its transpose.

   b. **The product of two rotation matrices is a rotation matrix.**
   
   **Proof:**
   Let \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) be two rotation matrices in \( SO(3) \). 
   The product \( R = R_1 R_2 \) is also a rotation matrix if:
   1. \( R^T R = I \)
   2. \( det(R) = 1 \)

   Using the properties of transposition:
   \[ (R_1 R_2)^T = R_2^T R_1^T \]

   Now, since \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are rotation matrices:
   \[ R_1^T R_1 = I \]
   \[ R_2^T R_2 = I \]

   Multiplying the two equations:
   \[ R_2^T R_1^T R_1 R_2 = I \]
   \[ (R_1 R_2)^T R_1 R_2 = I \]
   \[ R^T R = I \]

   Also, the determinant of the product of two matrices is the product of their determinants:
   \[ det(R_1 R_2) = det(R_1) det(R_2) \]
   Since \( det(R_1) = 1 \) and \( det(R_2) = 1 \):
   \[ det(R) = 1 \]

   Thus, \( R \) is a rotation matrix.

   c. **For any vector \( x \) in \( R^3 \), and \( R \) in \( SO(3) \), the vector \( y = Rx \) has the same length as \( x \).**
   
   **Proof:**
   The length (or norm) of a vector \( x \) is given by:
   \[ ||x|| = \sqrt{x^T x} \]

   The length of the vector \( y \) is:
   \[ ||y|| = \sqrt{y^T y} \]
   \[ ||y|| = \sqrt{(Rx)^T Rx} \]
   \[ ||y|| = \sqrt{x^T R^T Rx} \]

   Since \( R \) is a rotation matrix:
   \[ R^T R = I \]

   Thus:
   \[ ||y|| = \sqrt{x^T x} \]
   \[ ||y|| = ||x|| \]

   The lengths of \( x \) and \( y \) are the same.

   d. **The inverse of a transformation matrix is also a transformation matrix.**
   
   **Proof:**
   A transformation matrix \( T \) can be represented as:
   \[ T = \begin{bmatrix} R & t \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]
   Where \( R \) is a rotation matrix and \( t \) is a translation vector.

   The inverse of \( T \) is:
   \[ T^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} R^T & -R^T t \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

   This is also in the form of a transformation matrix. Thus, the inverse of a transformation matrix is also a transformation matrix.

**2. Design a robot in spatial space:**

   a. **Currently, you serve as a robotic engineer by a company, and your boss wants you to design a robot in spatial space to satisfy the following conditions:**
   
   Given:
   1. Max reachable distance: 1 meter
   2. Link length: 0.5m
   3. Degree of Freedom (DoF): 2

   **Design:**
   To achieve a maximum reachable distance of 1 meter using links of 0.5m length, we need two links. Each link will be connected by a revolute joint. 

   - **Number of Joints:** 2 (revolute joints)
   - **Number of Links:** 2 (each of 0.5m length)

   The robot will have a DoF of 2, meaning it can move in two independent directions. With two revolute joints, the robot can rotate each link independently, allowing it to reach any point within a circular area with a radius of 1 meter.

   b. **The payload of your design is 10 kg, but your boss wants your designed robots to handle 20 kg payload.**
   
   Given:
   1. Payload of current design: 10kg
   2. Load bearing capacity of each link: 5kg
   3. Desired payload: 20kg

   **Updated Design:**
   To handle a payload of 20kg, we need to distribute the load across multiple load-bearing links. Since each link can hold 5kg, we need a total of 4 load-bearing links to handle 20kg (5kg x 4 = 20kg).

   However, we need to maintain the maximum reachable distance of 1 meter. To achieve this, we can design the robot with a parallel mechanism. In this design, two sets of links will be parallel to each other, and each set will consist of two links of 0.5m length. This way, the robot can still reach a maximum distance of 1 meter while bearing a payload of 20kg.

   - **Number of Joints:** 4 (revolute joints)
   - **Number of Links:** 4 (each of 0.5m length)

   The Degree of Freedom (DoF) of the robot will still be 2. Even though we have added more joints and links, the robot's movement is constrained by the parallel mechanism, so it can still move in only two independent directions.

**3. As a robotic engineer, move the gripper on the UGV to the target object.**

Given the provided information, the task is to determine how to represent the target object in the gripper's frame. 

**Solution:**
To represent the target object in the gripper's frame, we need to find the transformation from the sensor's frame to the gripper's frame and then use the known location of the target object in the sensor

's frame.

Given:
1. Sensor’s location: \( T_{sd} \)
2. Chassis of the UGV’s location: \( T_{sb} \)
3. Gripper’s location: \( T_{sc} \)
4. Target object’s location: \( T_{se} \)

The transformation from the sensor's frame to the gripper's frame is given by:
\[ T_{cg} = T_{cb} T_{bd} T_{ds} \]
Where:
\[ T_{cb} = T_{sb}^{-1} T_{sc} \]
\[ T_{bd} = T_{sb}^{-1} T_{sd} \]
\[ T_{ds} = T_{sd}^{-1} T_{se} \]

Using the above transformations, we can represent the target object in the gripper's frame.

**4. Determine the rotation matrix for specific rotations and compute certain configurations related to the orientation of the body frame.**

a. **What is the rotation matrix \( R_x \) that represents a rotation of 30° of \( x \)? What is the rotation matrix \( R_z \) that represents a rotation of 45° of \( z \)?**

**Solution:**
The rotation matrix for a rotation about the x-axis by an angle \( \theta \) is:
\[ R_x(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) \\ 0 & \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix} \]

For \( \theta = 30° \) or \( \pi/6 \) radians:
\[ R_x(30°) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \sqrt{3}/2 & -1/2 \\ 0 & 1/2 & \sqrt{3}/2 \end{bmatrix} \]

The rotation matrix for a rotation about the z-axis by an angle \( \theta \) is:
\[ R_z(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) & 0 \\ \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

For \( \theta = 45° \) or \( \pi/4 \) radians:
\[ R_z(45°) = \begin{bmatrix} \sqrt{2}/2 & -\sqrt{2}/2 & 0 \\ \sqrt{2}/2 & \sqrt{2}/2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

b. **The orientation of the body frame is given as \( R_{sb} \). Please compute:**
i. \( R R_{sb}^T \) and \( R_{sb}^T R \)
ii. Explain the difference between the previous two results.

**Solution:**
Given:
\[ R_{sb} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -\sqrt{2}/2 & \sqrt{2}/2 \\ 0 & \sqrt{2}/2 & -\sqrt{2}/2 \end{bmatrix} \]

i. To compute \( R R_{sb}^T \) and \( R_{sb}^T R \), we first need to know the matrix \( R \). Without this matrix, we cannot compute the products. If \( R \) is provided, we can compute the products using standard matrix multiplication.

ii. The difference between \( R R_{sb}^T \) and \( R_{sb}^T R \) is the order of multiplication. Matrix multiplication is not commutative, meaning \( AB \) is not necessarily equal to \( BA \). The two results represent different transformations or rotations, depending on the context.
